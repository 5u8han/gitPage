## Education

I pursued a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Northeastern Illinois University, where I embraced a multitude of subjects such as Network Security, Information Technology, and Software Engineering. This academic voyage ignited my curiosity for innovation and problem-solving.

## Interests and Exploration

My enthusiasm for technology extends to a wide array of domains. Virtualization technologies like VMware ESXi, Hyper-V, Proxmox, and QEMU-KVM captivate me with their ability to reshape infrastructure landscapes. System administration, especially Windows Server management and Active Directory, empowers me to architect secure and streamlined systems.

I'm not just a backend enthusiast; front-end technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript also intrigue me. The art of crafting visually appealing and user-centric interfaces fascinates me.

## Aspirations

With every line of code I write and every concept I grasp, my aspiration to contribute to the ever-evolving tech world grows. Through continuous learning and exploration, I aim to create meaningful software solutions that simplify complexities and enhance user experiences.
